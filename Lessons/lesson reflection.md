# Unit reflection

## What worked well
Time management(I was Tasks, quizzes and the project)
Organising the repo
Quizzes were understandable and they helped in practicing good coding practices


## What did not work well
Flowcharts(Troublesome when drawing)
Snakify(Some of the problems were quite confusing)
My coding speed was slow which resulted me in working longer


## What did you enjoyed the most during the project unit 1?
Getting more familiar with python and also using logic to code


## What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
I am able to understand a code if I analayse it


## What is working well in Computer Science for you?
Solving quizzes is working very well. It makes me more familiar with the language whilst improving my understanding of problems.


## What can Dr Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
No more flowcharts and making us use more complicated functions/commands in the language apart from just using the basic commands.
