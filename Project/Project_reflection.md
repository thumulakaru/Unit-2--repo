# Project reflection
## What were the challenges and most enjoyable parts of the project?
Me and Krish had little bit of a trouble in building the circuit because we had to solder wires before building the circuit and it was very hard to access the resources required to do so. Since that part was removed from the project the next hardest thing was the documentation as there was a lot of information that we had but did not know how to present. So figuring out this part was the hardest part. As for the most enjoyable part it was being stressed because the server was down at the last minute and screaming every five second that we were going to fail the project.

## What did you do different?
The documentation was done alongside the code or sometimes even before the code as the way it is supposed be. This helped a lot in developing as we had a structure already. I used comments more effectively rather than just using comments as a method to extend the list of techniques used and show it to Dr. Ruben.

## What did you learn?
It never hurts to start early. We had little bit of a trouble at the end because we did not have enough materials in the beginning which resulted in us starting the project. Apart from this, since this was a group project I saw how Krish used the same code over and over to use it in the program which made the code extremely simple and understandable. Also I figured that ISAK wifi sometimes randomly stops working in the middle of the night.

## What are your goals for Unit 3 & 4?
If the next projects were to be group projects I would try to meet the group more often and start early as possible. Also in the next units I want understand the content that is covered in the class at the class rather than studying it afterwards. Also I want to write more accurate notes in class so that whenever I forget something I could just pull up the file and figure it out rather than having to read every line. Finally, I want to write code more accurately as I always make the same mistakes in the first two to three tries.
